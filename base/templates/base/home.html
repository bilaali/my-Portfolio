                        <h4>My Background</h4>
                        <hr>
                        <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Lahore and have completed my BSc and BA from University of Punjab, where I developed a strong foundation in math, science, and critical thinking. During my studies, I also honed my skills in programming and data analysis, which sparked my interest in machine learning and web development.</p>
                        <p>To further my knowledge and skills, I have been actively learning and practicing through online courses, projects, and collaborations with peers. I have experience working with languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, and frameworks like Django, and OpenCv.</p>
                        <p>In addition to technical skills, I possess excellent communication, collaboration, and leadership skills, which enable me to work effectively in teams and manage projects with efficiency and attention to detail.</p>
